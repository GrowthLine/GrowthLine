files to test the RHT03 ambient temperature and humidity sensor
Left-to-Right pin configuration: Vdd - Data - Null (no use) - Ground

dht.cpp and dht.h are the files needed by sensor

To read from the sensor, use the read22 function: sensorName.read22(dataPin)
It returns an integer that corresponds to the status of the sensor (in case it detects errors)
To get the data do:	sensorName.humidity 	and	sensorName.temperature
